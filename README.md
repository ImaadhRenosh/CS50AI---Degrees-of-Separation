Degrees of Separation

Overview
This project, part of Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python, implements a search algorithm to determine the shortest path between two actors based on their filmography. The program identifies the degrees of separation between actors, akin to the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" concept.

Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: CSV, sys, collections (deque)
- Tools: Git, VS Code

Installation & How to Run
To set up and run the project locally:

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/degrees-of-separation.git
   cd degrees-of-separation

2. Prepare the Data: Download the dataset from the CS50 AI Degrees project page and place the CSV files (people.csv, movies.csv, stars.csv) into the project directory.

3. Run the Application: Execute the program with:

   python degrees.py

4. Usage:

  When prompted, enter the names of two actors.
  The program will output the shortest path of movies and co-stars connecting the two actors.
