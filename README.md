## Overview
This project, part of Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python, implements a search algorithm to determine the shortest path between two actors based on their filmography.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** CSV, sys, collections (deque)
- **Tools:** Git, VS Code

## Prerequisites
- Python (version X.X or higher)
- Git
- A web browser

## Installation & How to Run
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ImaadhRenosh/cs50-ai-degrees.git
    cd cs50-ai-degrees
    ```

2. **Prepare the Data**: Download the dataset from the CS50 AI Degrees project page and place the CSV files (people.csv, movies.csv, stars.csv) into the project directory.

3. **Run the Application**: Execute the program with:
    ```sh
    python degrees.py
    ```

  - Displays the initial view of the program, before the user inputs the names of two actors.

  - Highlights the program that determines how many “degrees of separation” apart two actors are.



## Usage
After launching the application, you can:
- When prompted, enter the names of two actors.
- The program will output the shortest path of movies and co-stars connecting the two actors.
